üîπ Theory:
Multithreading allows multiple threads to execute concurrently within a single process. It simulates interprocess communication by sharing memory and synchronizing access using locks or semaphores. This is useful in systems where tasks like reading, writing, or calculating can happen in parallel, enhancing performance and responsiveness.

‚úÖ Advantages:
Efficient CPU utilization.

Faster task handling with reduced wait time.

Enables asynchronous communication.

‚ùå Disadvantages:
Risk of race conditions and deadlocks.

Requires careful synchronization.

Can be difficult to debug and test.

üîö Conclusion:
Multithreading is an effective way to simulate process communication and improve parallelism in distributed or concurrent applications.
